also this has no connection to my account, but download stuff just in case

# sn.ahk
this script requires autohotkey: https://www.autohotkey.com/
* look at the script to check you're ok with what it does!
* download the script to any folder
* run the script
* load up SN and click type mode
* press shift + middle mouse button to start running the script
* let it kill all the lights for you! you'll need to stay clicked into the game since the script will spam keys (ws, ad, wdwd, or wasd randomly)
* unless you edit the numbers (and feel free to do so), it'll stop at around 10k points (which gets you 300p and a SN parfait). please note that the script doesn't exit by itself, it just sits there in the tray - you'll have to close it manually once you're done cheesing the game
